# whoAmIWebsite

This website was created for a Computer Science 10 project, on creating websites.

About the weird artifacts and colours on images when loading:

The image files were (relatively) huge, and when you have as many as this project does, on a website this small, the files sizes make a huge difference. They also made loading up pages slower.
I went to an online photo compressor and put all of the jpgs through. It brought the media folder down from around 50mbs, to 11mbs. But, now when you load up images on the website they look weird until they're fully loaded up. I'd say it's worth it, since this is only a school project, and never going to be published.
