		<p>My name is Luke, and I am a student at Queen Elizabeth High School. On my own time, I mainly work on computers and photography.</br></br>Working with and on computers, and I have done a lot of stuff. That includes the languages, html, css, processing, and python. Working in these languages I have made a few simple games and websites. Going forward with programming, I would like to learn more about backend web development, and machine learning.</br></br>Photography is something else that I enjoy. I like photography because it makes me look at things differently. I started learning photography in grade 8, and am still working on it. I mainly shoot photos on film, both because I canâ€™t afford a digital camera, and because I like what film does differently.</p>
